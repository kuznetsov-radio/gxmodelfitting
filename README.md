This code searches for the heating rate that provides the best agreement between the model and observed radio maps, for the specified parameters a and b of the coronal heating model.

The central routine that calls all other ones is MultiScanAB.pro - see that file for the description of the parameters. An example of calling the code is presented in the file examples\TestCHMP.pro (the sample model and observational data are not included).
